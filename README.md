# Advent of Code 2025 

It's that time of year again for [Advent of Code]. Unlike previous years,
the 2025 edition will only feature 12 days of puzzles which means I 
have more time to work on them with work chewing most of my time. This
repo will contain my Golang solutions.

| Day | Solution | Puzzle               |
|-----|----------|----------------------|
| 01  | [day01/] | [Secret Entrance]    |
| 02  | [day02/] | [Gift Shop]          |
| 03  | [day03/] | [Lobby]              |
| 04  | [day04/] | [Printing Department]|
| 05  | [day05/] | [Cafeteria]          |
| 06  | [day06/] | [Trash Compactor]    |
| 07  | [day07/] | [Laboratories]       |
| 08  | [day08/] | [Playground]         |
| 09  | [day09/] | [Movie Theater]      |
| 10  | [day10/] | [Factory]            |
| 11  | [day11/] | [Reactor]            |
