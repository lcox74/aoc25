# Advent of Code 2025 

It's that time of year again for [Advent of Code]. Unlike previous years,
the 2025 edition will only feature 12 days of puzzles which means I 
have more time to work on them with work chewing most of my time. This
repo will contain my Golang solutions.

| Day | Solution | Puzzle            |
|-----|----------|-------------------|
| 01  | [day01/] | [Secret Entrance] |
| 02  | [day02/] | [Gift Shop] |

[day01/]: ./day01/
[day02/]: ./day02/
[Secret Entrance]: (https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1) 
[Gift Shop]: (https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2)
